# Chronic Care Management Project Overview
This project supports an open community that is interested in developing specifications and reference implementations to improve point-of-care planning and management for chronic health conditions. The solutions will address requirements for team-based care that spans multiple provider organizations and will also address the requirements for person-centered care planning with active engagement by patients.

For more information, see the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/chronic-care/project-plan/wiki)
